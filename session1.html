    <!-- <p>I couldn’t get a job in IT because of my 2-year gap after graduation. Then, I was searching on google for good institutes that teach Data Science. Luckily I found EdYoda. Joining EdYoda was one of the best decisions I took. They supported me in every possible way and cleared all my doubts every now and then. I just love EdYoda’s teaching methodology. I would suggest everyone join this institute as their program content is up to date.</p>
